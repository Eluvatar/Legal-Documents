TNP LEGAL DOCUMENT HISTORY
==========================

This repository is intended to track the history of The North Pacific's legal documents, in continuous operation, to the present day.

This commit is intended to show the state of the two immediately adopted legal documents following the Constitutional Convention of June 2005.

TNP Laws 1 to 3 were inherited directly from the **North Pacific Confederation**, the primary opposition to the **North Pacific Directorate** during the "Pixiedance Wars" of January-May 2005.

The constitution itself and TNP Law 4 were adopted by referendum June 30th through July 6th, 2005.
