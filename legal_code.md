*Criminal Trial Procedures* 

### Section 1: Trial Rules and Procedures
Until and unless the provisi ons of this Section 1 are modified by laws enacted as part of The North Pacific Legal Code, and subject to any additional procedures added by The North Pacific Legal Code:  
***1) Duties of Attorney General in Trial Proceedings*** - The Attorney General shall be the Chief Prosecutor in The North Pacific and shall be the default prosecutor for all cases brought to trial in The North Pacific unless the Attorney General is charged, In that event the prosecutor shall be selected by the Chief Justice in a manner that is not arbitrary or capricious. The Attorney General may also choose to delegate the Prosecutor's role to a registered voter who shall not be a member of the current Cabinet.  
***2) Trial Preparations*** - Unless extended by a motion of either side showing reasonable grounds granted by the presiding officer for the trial, the defendant, prosecutor and their legally recognized representatives have 24 hours to prepare their cases before a trial begins. If the defendant refuses to participate or requests counsel, a public defender shall be provided. Once a criminal charge is brought forth, neither the accuser, the defendant, or any party legally recognized as representing them, may reveal or discuss any details of the charge except in areas where specifically asked to do so by the presiding officer of the trial or a legal appointee of the Court. If discussion about the charge, or subjects related to the charge, is already ongoing at the time that the charge is made, the accuser, the defendant, and any party legally recognized as representing either of them, are forbidden to continue participating in the discussions. That ban shall continue until the case is resolved and closed by the proper legal official, as mandated by this Constitution, The North Pacific Legal Code, or other laws of the Region.  
***3) Jury Selection*** - Five jurors will be randomly selected by the presiding officer from a pool of registered voters. Registered voters who have an expressed bias or whom who have served on a jury in the past three months will be automatically excluded. If either counsel believes one of the selected jurors is unfit to serve for reasons of bias or a conflict of interest, the presiding officer will review the charge and if he/she finds it valid, the next available juror will be chosen from the random drawing list. If selected, a juror may decline to serve before the trial begins. Once the trial is started, the juror is required to complete their obligation.  
***4) Trial Procedure*** - The presiding officer shall list the charges against the defendant and give instructions to the jury regarding deliberations and recommended sentences if the defendant is found guilty. The prosecutor will then present evidence and witnesses relating to the charges. Afterwards, the Nation on trial (or their counsel) will present evidence and witnesses in their defense.  
***5) Jury Deliberations*** - After both sides have presented their cases, the jury will deliberate on the verdict and, if the Nation is found guilty, determine the sentence. A majority of the jurors is required to reach a verdict and pass a sentence.  
***6) Conclusion*** - Once the jury has reached a verdict, it will be delivered to the presiding officer to be announced. The trial will be concluded once the presising officer confirms and enforces the verdict.
